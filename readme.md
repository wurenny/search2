# search2 | [[中文]](https://github.com/wurenny/search2/blob/master/readme-zh.md)
## Introduction
search2 is a practical and extensible search assistant, here is about me：
1. search2 follows four design principles: lightness, simplicity, ease of use, and scalability"
1. search2 does not introduce any third-party javascript libraries. It only loads on user-defined search engine pages"
1. search2 has extremely simple user interfaces, occupying only a small space on the page. It can even be hidden to the side to minimize interference with the user's original web experience"
1. search2 also adheres to Google's philosophy: a) user-centered, fully considering user habits; b) faster is better, with quick responses, as fast a web experience as possible; c) the web is fair and democratic, not bundling any search engines, including Google itself, and all search engines are fully customizable by users"
1. search2 requires a Chrome webkit version greater than 21 to function properly. Starting from version v2.0.0, it supports manifest v3"
1. The past mind is unattainable, The present mind is unattainable, The future mind is unattainable
